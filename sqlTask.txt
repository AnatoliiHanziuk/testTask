Assume a database with the following structure:

Members
ID	NAME 	ADDRESS	PHONE NUMBER	AGE

Organization
ID	MEMBER_ID	LOCATION	DUES
 
1.     Write a query that lists each member name, address, dues and location.

SELECT name, address, dues, location 
FROM Members memb
LEFT JOIN Organization org
ON memb.id = org.member_id;

2.     Write a SQL Query to pull all members that are over 45

SELECT * FROM Members WHERE age > 45;

3.     Write a SQL Query to pull all members that have a dues value of 0.

SELECT name, address, dues, location 
FROM Members memb
JOIN Organization org
ON memb.id = org.member_id
WHERE org.dues = 0;
