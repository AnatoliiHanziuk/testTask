#Question 1

I implemented singly linked list data structure from scratch.
As a node there can be object of any type.

I decided to use 2 iterators:
The first one incriments by 1 and the second one moves in two times faster.
When the end point of list (null) element is reached by the second iterator 
the first iterator should show on the middle element of the list.

Assumption: is there are 2 middle elements then the middle element is the second elements of founded tuple.

#Question 2

Because of list of arrays is unordered I decided to use Set data structure.

#Question 3
